@book{diaconis1988group,
	Abstract = {The purpose of this nice little book is to show how the mathematical theory of group representations can be used to solve very concrete problems in probability and statistics. It is mainly concerned with noncommutative finite groups. Let us describe two of its typical simple examples.

The first one is card shuffling. A deck of cards is repeatedly shuffled. For instance, a random card is transposed with the top one, or two cards chosen at random with each hand are transposed (one can also cut about half the pack and riffle the two packets together). How many shuffles are necessary in order to bring the deck of cards close to random? Repeated shuffling is modeled as convolving a fixed probability measure on the symmetric group. The problem is to find the rate of convergence of these convolution powers to the uniform distribution. Group representations turns the analysis of convolutions into the more manageable analysis of products. This leads to very explicit new results (in Chapter 3).

The second example comes from classical analysis of variance. Let $X=\{1,\cdots,n\}\times\{1,\cdots,m\}$. Consider real data $x_{ij}$, $(i,j)\in X$, which are collected in a two-way layout. The rows represent the levels of a factor and the columns the levels of a second factor. The order in which the rows (and the columns) appear is not of any significance. Therefore it is natural to introduce the group $G=X_n\times S_m$ acting on $X$. Let $L(X)$ be the set of functions on $X$. A set of data is an element of this space. Let $L(X)=V_0\oplus V_1\oplus V_2\oplus V_3$ be the decomposition of $L(X)$ into irreducible components under the action of $G$. Then projection on $V_0$ gives the grand mean, the projection on $V_1$ gives the influence of rows, that a $V_2$ gives the influence of columns, and that a $V_3$ gives what is left over (residuals). We just recover the usual ANOVA. But, when this spectral analysis is applied to less standard kinds of data, it gives in a systematic way a decomposition into factors which is not so obvious to guess.

This book contains 9 chapters. Chapters 2 and 7 develop, in a very friendly way and from first principles, all the tools of group representations which are needed. Chapters 3 and 4 deal with random walks on groups and study problems of the same kind as the card shuffling example above. The other chapters give statistical applications (such as data analysis as in the second example above, partially ranked data, data with values in homogeneous spaces, models). The book contains a very useful annotated bibliography.

This book is remarkable. On the one hand it is a research book (most of the material appears in book form here for the first time), using tools from one of the main active fields in ``pure mathematics''. On the other hand, it is very clear and self-contained. Both the pure mathematician and the applied statistician will find pleasure and excitement in reading it. The text is full of attractive examples. It contains many open questions and I am sure that it will be the starting point for new research on the subject. },

@article{citeulike:8461510,
	Abstract = { A new psychological law, called the law of comparative judgment, is presented with some of its special applications in the measurement of psychological values. This law is applicable not only to the comparison of physical stimulus intensities but also to qualitative comparative judgments, such as those of excellence of specimens in an educational scale. It should be possible also to verify it on comparative judgments which involve simultaneous and successive contrast. The law is stated as {follows:[Equation} omitted]in which S-sub(1) and S-sub(2) are the psychological scale values of the two compared stimuli; x-sub(12) is the sigma value corresponding to the proportion of judgments p-sub(1) > p-sub(2). ς-sub(1) is the discriminal dispersion of stimulus R-sub(1) and ς-sub(2) is the dispersion of stimulus R-sub(2). r is the correlation between the discriminal deviations of R-sub(1) and R-sub(2) in the same judgment. This law is basic for work on Weber's and Fechner's laws, applies to the judgments of a single observer who compares a series of stimuli by the method of paired comparisons when no "equal" judgments are allowed, and is a rational equation for the method of constant stimuli. The law is then applied to five cases each of which involves different assumptions and different degrees of simplification of the law for practical use. The weighting of the observation equations is discussed because the observation equations obtained with the five cases are not of the same reliability and hence should not be equally weighted.

	Abstract = {This paper performs a comparison of several methods for Kemeny rank aggregation (104 algorithms and combinations thereof in total) originating in social choice theory, machine learning, and theoretical computer science, with the goal of establishing the best trade-offs between search time and performance. We find that, for this theoretically NP-hard task, in practice the problems span three regimes: strong consensus, weak consensus, and no consensus. We make specific recommendations for each, and propose a computationally fast test to distinguish between the regimes. In spite of the great variety of algorithms, there are few classes that are consistently Pareto optimal. In the most interesting regime, the integer program exact formulation, local search algorithms and the approximate version of a theoretically exact branch and bound algorithm arise as strong contenders.},

	Abstract = {In a general flow-shop situation, where all the jobs must pass through all the machines in the same order, certain heuristic algorithms propose that the jobs with higher total process time should be given higher priority than the jobs with less total process time. Based on this premise, a simple algorithm is presented in this paper, which produces very good sequences in comparison with existing heuristics. The results of the proposed algorithm have been compared with the results from 15 other algorithms in an independent study by Park [13], who shows that the proposed algorithm performs especially well on large flow-shop problems in both the static and dynamic sequencing environments.},

	Abstract = {The problem of scheduling jobs in a flow-shop is considered. The job processing order must be the same on each machine and the objective is to minimize the maximum completion time. Simulated annealing is proposed as a heuristic to obtain approximate solutions. Extensive computational tests with problems having up to 20 machines and 100 jobs show simulated annealing to compare favourably with known constructive heuristics and with descent methods.},

	Abstract = {Traditionally, the permutation flowshop scheduling problem (PFSP) was with the criterion of minimizing makespan. The permutation flowshop scheduling problem to minimize the total flowtime has attracted more attention from researchers in recent years. In this paper, a hybrid genetic local search algorithm is proposed to solve this problem with each of both criteria. The proposed algorithm hybridizes the genetic algorithm and a novel local search scheme that combines two local search methods: the Insertion Search (IS) and the Insertion Search with Cut-and-Repair (ISCR). It employs the genetic algorithm to do the global search and two local search methods to do the local search. Two local search methods play different roles in the search process. The Insertion Search is responsible for searching a small neighborhood while the Insertion Search with Cut-and-Repair is responsible for searching a large neighborhood. Furthermore, the orthogonal-array-based crossover operator is designed to enhance the GA's capability of intensification. The experimental results show the advantage of combining the two local search methods. The performance of the proposed hybrid genetic algorithm is very competitive. For the PFSP with the total flowtime criterion, it improved 66 out of the 90 current best solutions reported in the literature in short-term search and it also improved all the 20 current best solutions reported in the literature in long-term search. For the PFSP with the makespan criterion, the proposed algorithm also outperforms the other three methods recently reported in the literature.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, a HGA (hybrid genetic algorithm) is proposed for permutation flowshop scheduling problems (PFSP) with total flowtime minimization, which are known to be NP-hard. One of the chromosomes in the initial population is constructed by a suitable heuristic and the others are yielded randomly. An artificial chromosome is generated by a weighted simple mining gene structure, with which a new crossover operator is presented. Additionally, two effective heuristics are adopted as local search to improve all generated chromosomes in each generation. The HGA is compared with one of the most effective heuristics and a recent meta-heuristic on 120 benchmark instances. Experimental results show that the HGA outperforms the other two algorithms for all cases. Furthermore, HGA obtains 115 best solutions for the benchmark instances, 92 of which are newly discovered.},

The problem is to find an optimum set of n - 1 first order dependence relationship among the n variables. It is shown that the procedure derived in this paper yields an approximation of a minimum difference in information.

In this paper we deal with the problems of sampling and learning (estimating) such distributions when the metric on permutations is the Cayley distance. We propose new methods for both operations, whose performance is shown through several experiments. We also introduce novel procedures to count and randomly generate permutations at a given Cayley distance both with and without certain structural restrictions. An application in the field of biology is given to motivate the interest of this model.},

	abstract = 	 {Recently, probability models on rankings have been proposed in the field of estimation of distribution algorithms in order to solve permutation-based combinatorial optimisation problems. Particularly, distance-based ranking models, such as Mallows and Generalized Mallows under the Kendall?s-t distance, have demonstrated their validity when solving this type of problems. Nevertheless, there are still many trends that deserve further study. In this paper, we extend the use of distance-based ranking models in the framework of EDAs by introducing new distance metrics such as Cayley and Ulam. In order to analyse the performance of the Mallows and Generalized Mallows EDAs under the Kendall, Cayley and Ulam distances, we run them on a benchmark of 120 instances from four well known permutation problems. The conducted experiments showed that there is not just one metric that performs the best in all the problems. However, the statistical test pointed out that Mallows-Ulam EDA is the most stable algorithm among the studied proposals.},

  abstract = {Regularization is a well-known technique in statistics for model estimation which is used to improve the generalization ability of the estimated model. Some of the regularization methods can also be used for variable selection that is especially useful in high-dimensional problems. This paper studies the use of regularized model learning in estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) for continuous optimization based on Gaussian distribu tions. We introduce two approaches to the regularized model estimation and analyze their effect on the accuracy and computational complexity of model learning in EDAs. We then apply the proposed algorithms to a number of continuous optimization functions and compare their results with other Gaussian distribution-based EDAs. The results show that the optimization performance of the proposed RegEDAs is less affected by the increase in the problem size than other EDAs, and they are able to  obtain significantly better optimization values for many of the functions in high-dimensional settings.

The important role played by EDAs implementations in the usability and range of applications of these algorithms is considered. A survey of available EDA software is presented, and classifications based on the class of programming languages and design strategies used for their implementations are discussed. The paper also reviews different directions to improve current EDA implementations. A number of lines for further expanding the areas of application for EDAs software are proposed.},
